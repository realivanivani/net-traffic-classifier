GenAI-Generated Notebooks for Net-Traffic-Classifier

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks generated using various GenAI models (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) to explore anomaly detection for the Net-Traffic-Classifier project. The goal was to provide the same dataset and task to these models and compare their approaches and results.

Key Features:
	â€¢	Data Preprocessing: Includes cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis steps.
	â€¢	Model Development: Each notebook demonstrates unique machine learning pipelines, algorithms, and hyperparameter tuning.
	â€¢	Evaluation: Metrics such as precision, recall, and AUC are used for performance comparison.
	â€¢	Insights: Observations on the strengths and weaknesses of the generated approaches.

These notebooks serve as a benchmark for assessing GenAI-generated solutions and as a resource for enhancing the projectâ€™s anomaly detection capabilities.

Feel free to explore and adapt these workflows for your projects! ðŸš€
