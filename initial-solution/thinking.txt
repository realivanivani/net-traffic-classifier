Observations:
There are 2 types of requests, GET and POST
They seem similar, except that POST requests have an additional line after
There is a lot of attributes that repeat, meaning they are not important

This is my thinking process:
1. Idea was to parse every word from each HTTP request and save it as a feature
2. Select the features that have some variance. For the beginning I can just simple look at the sum
3. Use OneClassSVM for classification
4. Get the parameters with GridSearchCV
