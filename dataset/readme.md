# Dataset for CSIC 2010 HTTP Request Classification

This directory contains the CSIC 2010 dataset, which is used for parsing, analyzing, and classifying HTTP requests as part of a network traffic classification project. The aim is to distinguish between normal (legitimate) and malicious (anomalous) HTTP requests.

## Contents

- **csic_dataset.zip**: This zip file contains the raw dataset used for training and evaluating HTTP request classifiers. Extracting this file will yield three text files:
  - **normalTrafficTraining.txt**: Contains HTTP requests representing normal traffic used for training classifiers.
  - **normalTrafficTest.txt**: Contains HTTP requests representing normal traffic used for testing classifiers.
  - **anomalousTrafficTest.txt**: Contains HTTP requests representing malicious or anomalous traffic used for testing classifiers.

## Data Source

The dataset can be downloaded from the [official website](http://www.isi.csic.es/dataset/).

## Dataset Format

Each file contains multiple rows, each representing an HTTP request with the following structures:

```

## Usage

To utilize this dataset for training and evaluating a classifier, follow these steps:

1. **Extract** the `csic_dataset.zip` file to access the individual `.txt` files.
2. **Parse** the HTTP requests by processing the lines in each file to extract meaningful features for classification.
3. **Preprocess** the data, which may involve tokenizing requests, handling URL parameters, and encoding categorical features.
4. **Train** your classifier using `normalTrafficTraining.txt` as the training set.
5. **Evaluate** the classifier's performance on both `normalTrafficTest.txt` and `anomalousTrafficTest.txt`.

## Notes

- The data must be preprocessed and feature-engineered before being fed into machine learning models.
- Consider both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches, depending on your analysis goals.

## Licensing and Citation

Please ensure you comply with any licensing terms provided by the dataset source. If using the data for research or publication, cite the original dataset appropriately.
